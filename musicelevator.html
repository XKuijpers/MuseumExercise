                <h2>Why did I choose this?</h2>
                <p>I chose this art piece, because I personally love music a lot and listen to it almost 24/7. The voices adjusting their toneheight depending on the floor that you are really reminded me of music, and also how it is almost always around me. It also shows how even the smallest addition to something could make it more fun, which is why I feel like it is important to remember the small things as well in your biggest memories.</p>
