                <h2>Why did I choose this?</h2>
                <p>I chose this art piece, because creating an entire weapon out of candy like this would obviously take a lot of time, effort, and patience to do so. Hence why I chose this, as I have a lot of patience usually, and always try my best and put a lot of effort into my (school)projects. On top of that, I'm very good at time management as well, which ticks off all 3 of the boxes.</p>
