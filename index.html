            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>For this schoolproject, we had to visit the van Abbemuseum inside of Eindhoven. We first started out with a tour of the museum hosted by the museum's staff, after which we then had to walk around on our own and find 4 different artpieces which we are interested in/represents us and our personality. In the navigation at the top of the page, you're able to navigate yourself to the 4 different artpieces which I've chosen, in which you're able to find more information about it.</p>
