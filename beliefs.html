                <h2>Why did I choose this?</h2>
                <p>I chose this art piece, because I personally believe that it's a good thing that everyone has their own ideas and beliefs of the world around them, as long as they're critical thinkers. And although I personally don't agree with the statements in this picture, it does show how you can question everything in the world around you, which could develop your personality further.</p>
